<Article title="Our Story">
	The Responsive community started out as just a simple <a rel="external" href="https://twitch.tv/vandesm14" target="_blank">Twitch channel</a>. Leon (Leonski) and I (TheDevBird) created a <a href="https://discord.gg/semsxbP" target="_blank">Discord server</a> to help grow my Twitch community. At that point, all I streamed was web development projects. Since then, the community has grown at an exponential scale. Now, we're not only hosting streams, but regular conversation, <a href="/events">events</a>, and have even started a <a href="/podcast">podcast series</a>. For the future of Responsive, Leon and I plan on growing much larger than this, with our own help station, multiple events running in parallel, and even a whole stream-team & podcast group!
