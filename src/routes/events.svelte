	<h2>Sci-Fi Interface Contest</h2>
	<p><strong><strong>This jam will be based around sci-fi interfaces!</strong></strong> Your UI can be whatever you want, this is a design &amp; creativity contest! The more gizmos, animations, and sci-fi flair, the better! A good reference for your UI would be sci-fi interfaces used in movies and TV shows. Be creative!</p><br>
	<p>PS: If you only know a language that can&#39;t do GUIs but can do CLIs, that works too! (choose what you&#39;re most comfortable with)</p><br>
	<p><strong><strong>Winning PRIZE:</strong> 1 month of Discord Nitro</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Starts on:</strong> Friday, April 2nd
	<strong>Ends on:</strong> Friday, April 16th</p>

	<p><strong><strong>Requirements:</strong></strong></p>
	<ol>
	<li>Your UI <strong>MUST</strong> be created with code, no graphic design software or animation software should be used</li>

	<li>A popup/popout with at least 1 form of input (eg: a right-click menu with buttons)</li>

	</ol>
	<p><strong><strong>Bonus Points:</strong></strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Although functionality isn&#39;t really important outside of a UI standpoint, if you add scripting to your UI to have buttons and knobs change values and change display graphics, you&#39;ll get some sweet bonus points!</li>
	<li>For the web devs out there, SVG animations would be a great touch!</li>
	</ul>
